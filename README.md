# CIS569_DataVisualizaitonClass

In this project, you will create an interactive visualization for the project dataset published in myCourses. All 3 projects of this course are correlated with each other.

The visualization should include the following two parts:
A list of document IDs.
A workspace that allows displaying the text of documents (similar to the visual metaphor of opening a text file in MS word).

Your visualization should include the following interactive features:
Order the list of document IDs with direct manipulation (do not use menus or buttons).
Selecting an item in the document ID list will show the text of this document in the workspace.
Users can select multiple document IDs from the list, which opens multiple documents in the workspace.
Users can drag and move an opened document in the workspace.

You can use any web-based technology to develop this interactive visualization. D3 and jQuery are recommended.

You are encouraged to work on the project in a group (at most 3 team members). If you want to do those projects by yourself, it would be fine. In the following up projects, we will build on more functions to this visual analytics tool for collaborative analysis.

Write a summary document to describe your design of ordering the list of document IDs with direct manipulation, and how to run your code. The document should be in MS Word (Times New Roman font, size 12, single line spacing, page limit: 2).

Since this is a programming project, you should use good software engineering practices. Comment your code, use consistent formatting, use meaningful variable names, etc.
