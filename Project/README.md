# CIS569_Visual Analytics

In this project, you will create an interactive visualization for the project dataset published in myCourses. All 3 projects of this course are correlated with each other.

The visualization should include the following two parts:

+ A list of document IDs.
+ A workspace that allows displaying the text of documents (similar to the visual metaphor of opening a text file in MS word).

+ Your visualization should include the following interactive features:
 - Order the list of document IDs with direct manipulation (do not use menus or buttons).
 - Selecting an item in the document ID list will show the text of this document in the workspace.
 - Users can select multiple document IDs from the list, which opens multiple documents in the workspace.
 - Users can drag and move an opened document in the workspace.

+  You can use any web-based technology to develop this interactive visualization. D3 and jQuery are recommended.
